In this repository, I share my first PhD paper and a piece of my code in MATLAB that re-generates Fig. 4b in the paper (for a different trajectory than that in the paper).

In my Phd, I studied short chains of paramagnetic particles submerged in a fluid and subjected to an external rotating magnetic field. These particle systems have many proven and potential applications in microfluidics and bio industry. The uploaded paper is my first PhD paper that discusses one of my most significant PhD results: above a certain rotational frequency of the field, the chain of the particles breaks up and particles undergo an episode of chaotic motion which is temporary. The long term response of the particles is forming ordered and rotating structures that are stable. The MATLAB code re-generates Fig. 4b in the paper that shows this sharp transition from chaos to order.
